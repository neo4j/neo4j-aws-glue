# Neo4j Connector for AWS Glue

## Preface

The JDBC driver for AWS Glue is the original Neo4j JDBC driver with an additional translator module that rewrites some SQL queries generated by AWS Glue to be compatible with the expected SQL-support in the driver.
It’s not a patched but a rebundled version and only adds a translator implementation to the releases.
As this, it depends on the Neo4j JDBC driver and can benefit from all improvements from it when updating the upstream version.

Everything that is doable with the JDBC driver, can also be done within Glue as long as the environment allows it. The complete documentation of the Neo4j JDBC driver can be found here https://neo4j.com/docs/jdbc-manual/current/
